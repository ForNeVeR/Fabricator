Fabricator
==========
Fabricator is a hackable DevOps platform, similar to
PowerShell's [Desired State Configuration][powershell-dsc] in concept.

Core Concepts
-------------
The main core concept in Fabricator is a [_resource_][iresource].

Every entity controlled by Fabricator is a _resource_. A _resource_ knows a target state, knows how to check if the system corresponds to this state, and how to transform the system to this target state.

An example of a resource is a file, or a service.

Full system state, from Fabricator's point of view, corresponds to a set of resources. A resource may depend on other resources: its dependencies have to be applied before the resource itself.

When executing the `apply` command, Fabricator will check each resource's state (including the dependencies) and apply the resource if it isn't applied yet, after its dependencies. Checks are performed in parallel, and independent resources are applied in parallel.
